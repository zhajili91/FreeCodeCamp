Ask a user for their personal information one question at a time. Then check that the information they entered is
valid. Finally, print a summary of all the information they entered back to them.

Example: What is your name? If the user enters * you prompt them that the input is wrong, and ask them to enter a
valid name.

At the end you print a summary that looks like this:

- Name: John Doe
- Date of birth: Jan 1, 1954
- Address: 24 fifth Ave, NY
- Personal goals: To be the best programmer there ever was.
