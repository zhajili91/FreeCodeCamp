"""
You ask a user to guess a number between 1 and 50.
If they guess outside that range, you prompt with an error encouraging them to choose a number within the proper range.
Whenever they guess the wrong number you ask if they want to keep playing or if they'd like to quit.
Finally, when the user eventually guesses the right number you congratulate them and show the number of attempts they
had.
